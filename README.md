# PC_Parts
This is created for the purpose of fulfilling requirements for a software development final assessment as well as some extras for personal learning.

To get the server working retrieve the exact path of the 'PC_Parts_Data.mdf file from the database folder. In the "connectionString, AttachDBFilename=" section of "PC_Parts_Selfhost/App.config" replace the existing path with the new one.

Build the entire project and deploy the UWP application.

From here it can be tested by running the selfhost first in the background then each of the two applications in addition.
